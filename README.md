# cities-gui
Cities is a JFrame GUI that displays the name, state, and population of  large US cities in a scroll-able text area. 

There are several options to  customize the way the cities are displayed. 
Users can choose to display only cities from certain states using a combo box/drop down menu. 
Users can also sort the cities by name or by population.
